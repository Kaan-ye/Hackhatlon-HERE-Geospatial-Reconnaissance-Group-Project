#  Urban Road Network Expansion Analysis – Chennai, India

 **HERE Berlin GEOAI Hackathon 2025**  
Hosted at HERE Technologies, Berlin |  April 10–11, 2025

---

##  Overview

This project was developed by Team **Spatial Reconnaissance** during the HERE Berlin GEOAI Hackathon 2025. Over two days, we worked on a real-world geospatial challenge focused on **urban infrastructure** and **smart map enhancements**.

Using historical road network data from **HERE Sample Data for Students** (2017–2019), we analyzed spatial changes and expansion patterns in **Chennai, India**, with the goal of forecasting future developments and uncovering urban growth trends.

##  Objectives

- Analyze road network expansion between 2017–2019.
- Detect spatial changes and trends using geospatial tools.
- Build predictive models to forecast future growth.
- Visualize insights through informative and intuitive maps.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – data analysis, preprocessing, ML modeling.
- **MATLAB** – statistical modeling and image processing.
- **QGIS** – spatial data visualization and mapping.
- **Voronoi Diagrams**, **Heatmaps**, and **Regression Models** for insight generation.

---

##  Methodology

1. **Data Extraction**  
   - Extracted and cleaned road network data from Excel files exported from QGIS (2017, 2018, 2019).-

2. **Change Detection**  
   - Identified new road segments using coordinate comparisons.  
   - Calculated network expansion vectors and densities.

3. **Visualization**  
   - Generated heatmaps to show densification areas.  
   - Created Voronoi diagrams to analyze spatial influence zones.

4. **Forecasting**  
   - Trained regression models to predict likely expansion areas. 
   - Visualized results for 2025 scenario simulation.
